In 2025 I tried to spend less time on social media and more time reading long-form content.
I ended up reading 19 books which isn't a lot, but it's a lot for me.
I also read a lot of papers, but don't remember all of them.

I also switched to [libro.fm](https://libro.fm/referral?rf_code=lfm765365) for all my audio books this year so I'll link to that since it also helped me de-Amazon my life.

Here's my favorite long-form content from 2025.

## The Invention of Air

[![The Invention of Air book cover](https://covers.libro.fm/9781440679377_1120.jpg)](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781440679377-the-invention-of-air)

A book about scientific discoveries in the late 1700s.
This book had a line that I've thought about all year and how it applies to a lot of things in life.

>When our ability to measure something improves by an order of magnitude our understanding of that thing fundementally changes.

This idea applies to so many things, and it was the most insightful thing to me. 

## Material World

[![Material World book cover](https://covers.libro.fm/9780593788264_1120.jpg)](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780593788264-material-world)

How sand, salt, iron, oil, copper, and lithium changed the world.

I loved this review of how these materials affect our modern world and where they come from.
I paired nicely with [Chip War](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781797147192-chip-war) which was good, but not one of my favories.

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

This is a collection of classic papers written by Eric S. Raymond that I had never read.
It was great and freely available online--I bought a physical copy.

Most of the papers were written more than 20-30 years ago and they apply to today's and tomorrow's software and open source ecosystem.

My most memorable quote had to do with how to create quality software and I think this directly applies to the world of AI.

>Enjoyment predicts quality.

If you like the software you're writing, it's going to be better software.

## ChatGPT is Bullshit

This is a 2024 paper I read in 2025 and it was great!
It sussinctly explained a lot of the things I struggled to put into words.

The tl;dr

>...lying and hallucinating require some concern with the truth of their statements, whereas LLMs are simply not designed to accurately represent the way the world is, but rather to give the impression that this is what they’re doing.

>Because these programs cannot themselves be concerned with truth, and because they are designed to produce text that looks truth-apt without any actual concern for truth,it seems appropriate to call their outputs bullshit.
