I had the realization that I have been running a home lab in some form for over 20 years.
My first shared home lab was in 2004 with college roommates, and in 2005 I built my own.

## 2004

The first time I realized home labs were a thing was a house me and friends rented while in college.
We had a network capable Divx DVD player that would stream video files from a network share.

One of my roommates had set up a file server on a shuttle computer that was also used for ripping Netflix DVDs (did you know Netflix used to have DVDs).

Every 2 days, 4 Nextflix DVDs would come in the mail.
Four shuttle computers would rip the DVDs, and they'd be mailed back.

The movies were stored, labeled, and cataloged on an internal website.
I was blown away and hooked on home labbing.

We eventually replaced the Divx player with a modded Xbox running Xbox Media Player which was a huge step up in performance and compatibility for different media types and quality.
I kept the Xbox for a long time even though it wasn't my primary media player going forward.

## 2005 to 2009

My first home lab was a custom built PC for MythTV and a 2 bay Buffalo NAS.
It wasn't much, but it got me started recording live TV, storing backups, and running a couple small applications.
