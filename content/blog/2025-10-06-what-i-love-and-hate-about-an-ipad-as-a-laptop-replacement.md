I really tried to make it work.
I wanted it to work.
But I finally replaced my 11" iPad Pro (4th generation) with a real laptop.

Here's everything I loved and hated about using the iPad as my only mobile computing device.

### A little background

I started a new role in January 2024 and bought an iPad instead of a laptop.
I already have a desktop where I do the majority of my work and I wanted something I could easily travel with for some lighter work tasks.

Requirements:
* Small screen
* Terminal with ssh
* Tailscale

Wants:
* Davinci Resolve
* Stylus and digitizer for drawing
