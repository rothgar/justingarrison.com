## Comments

**Igniting the flame**

Humans need to rest. Even if you're excited about what you're doing you have to take a break. There's a reason it's called "burn out." You run out of fuel. It doesn't matter if your fuel is excitement, calories, or any other motivation. When it's gone the only thing you can do is stop and wait for it to come back.

**Too much**

I've been reserving this 2nd comment to continue to raise awareness about the war in Ukraine. I will continue to do so until the war is over, but there are so many other things happening in the world it's hard to pick just one major event.

All over the world there are human rights being violated, assassinations, weather catastrophes, and dozens more things to worry about. I am deeply sorry if any of these things have impacted you or people you know.

I hope you're able to enjoy the small things—like this newsletter—and stay safe.

Regex is difficult to write and comprehend to the average human reader because of its complex patterns. This website uses GPT-3 to generate regular expressions from plain English.

Want to sniff passwords on a Linux host? This is too cool and a bit scary. It's evidence that once you have access to lower levels in the stack you have a lot more access.
