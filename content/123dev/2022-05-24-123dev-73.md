**Garbage collection**

It's weird to think that our brains do garbage collection while we sleep. Reinforcing memories, storing things we don't need, and generally flushing toxins so we can be refreshed and think clearly for another day.

But humans have a finite runtime before we have to garbage collect sleep. Our ability to function relies heavily on our brain taking time to rest.

I’m on vacation this week. Hopefully garbage collecting.

**Ukraine**

It has been 3 months since this war started. I am glad to hear there is still some aid flowing into Ukraine, but I’m sure it’s not enough. The amount of death and destruction that has happened in the past 3 months is something I cannot understand. Knowing the numbers is not understanding.

Ukraine devops days is 3000€ away from their donation goal to help various charities. If you have the ability to give **I’ll match donations from this newsletter up to 1,500€**. If you donate please reply to this email with receipt. [https://devopsdays.com.ua/](https://devopsdays.com.ua/)

## Links

This week's gif comes from this link. Very good explanations—including gifs—showing how different types of garbage collection works in software.

Watch 5 different GC algorithm visualizations.

Deno is still one of those things I want to spend more time with. It seems like it has a lot of benefits over Node.js and I'm excited to see how it matures over time.

Convert typescript into Amazon State Language (ASL) used for Step functions. Great idea and the project also has a live playground where you can compile your step function flows.
