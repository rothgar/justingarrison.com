**Figuring it out**

It's so nice when you figure something out. It doesn't matter if it's a new technology, a hard problem, or a new way to explain something. Once you have the solution you can rely on that solutions for future, similar problems.

Humans are great pattern matchers. By recognizing small similarities in simple problems we can solve more complex problems.

One of the difficult things is knowing which tools to use. Because we rely on our experience so heavily we may not be able to find a tool that fits the problem and end up using something that is a poor fit. Will the problem get solved? Probably. Will it be the best solution? Likely not.

**Ukraine**

I continue to use one of the newsletter comments to draw attention to the war in Ukraine. This comment is the reason the newsletter is late this week because I had a hard time finding a new comment to share.

But that's not the point. The devastation in Ukraine has become a footnote for many news outlets. If there's nothing new to report it's not "news" no matter how tragic the status quo is. People are fighting for their country's freedom and risking their lives. People are taking refuge in foreign countries and many of them have lost all of their possessions.

I can't get over how I would feel if it happened to me and my family and my heart aches for what they are going through. I hope this ends soon.

Glory to Ukraine.

If you run containers in AWS this was a great, thorough review of the different options and how fast they scale. Scaling isn't the only thing to consider, but for some workloads it can be critical.
