## Motivation

> It is easier to educate a do-er than to motivate the educated

My experience at companies in various jobs and in open source communities echos this quote. I have had the privilege to work with some very smart people. If given the chance when starting a new project I will always pick the people who are excited to learn new things over the people who already know what to do.

## "In person"

I was physically present for part of Kubecon last week and I've come to realize I don't like calling conferences "virtual" and I prefer "remote" or "distributed." Virtual can imply that there are not real people you are interacting with in chat or in video calls. I know chat bots are popular but I don't look forward to attending conferences with them.

I had also forgotten what it was like to be in a large room with other people. I was thankful for all of the measures the conference had, but that didn't stop me from over-thinking ever moment I touched a door handle or my mask slipped below my nose.

Once I returned home and participated in the conference remotely the entire experience and my involvement changed drastically. I fell right back into the partial work, partial participation trap that I don't think will ever go away with remote conferences.

I've been using VS Code as my primary editor for over a year now and didn't know that code snippets can have variables or about LogPoints. Both seem very useful I am going to try to set up and remember to use.

If you ever use `watch` then you'll probably love `viddy`. It's a "modern" replacement with some nice things like history playback, keyboard shortcuts, and text search. It also has a nice output for demos.
