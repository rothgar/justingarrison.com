## Do you know how to say no?

People often feel guilty for saying no to opportunities, but in reality you should say no when you really care about something but know you are not the best person. It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re not interested, if you donâ€™t have enough time, or you donâ€™t have the right skills. If you understand saying no will make the project/event/collaboration/etc. more successful then you can better position yourself to say no and explain why.

I can imagine the guy in the gif originally thought he was helping by saying yes to this. It looks like everything worked out wellâ€¦ for the person throwing the ball.

## Links

You shouldÂ `curl -sL http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash`Â this link first and then wget the link to read the source. Bash, embedded python, and audio if youâ€™re on Linux â€” assuming your audio is working. :) Pretty amazing.

Nothing to see here

If you like ruby syntax but want something that can be compiled into a portable binary crystal looks like it could be a good fit. Iâ€™ve never written anything in it, but Iâ€™ve been watching it for a while. Great to see them release 1.0. ðŸŽ‰

With thousands of contributions from people worldwide, it was finally possible to find consensus for what truly mattered for 1.0 and what could wait for future releases. Getting here wasnâ€™t an easy journey, filled with enriching, controversial, delightful, and endless conversations that, in the end, made it possible to build a language more useful for more users.

I love Terraform. It can do a lot of things really well and with all of the provider plugins itâ€™s really easy to get started. I completely agree with this article that you shouldnâ€™t be deploying your applications with Terraform.

As much as some people want to stick with the tool theyâ€™re familiar with, Terraform can deploy software but youâ€™re going to hit a lot of limitations. You can try to mask those limitations or orchestrate Terraform apply commands with Jenkins. In reality you should use a different tool.

This is a loaded topic. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m going thereâ€“diving into the depths of a topic so heated, you probably already have strong opinions. Seriously, Terraform is not applicationâ€¦
