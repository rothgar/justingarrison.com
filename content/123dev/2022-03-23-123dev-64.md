## Comments

**Troubleshooting**

I spent most of my week trying to figure out problems with new systems with minimal feedback. Learning new tools and systems is hard. Doing it without insight into how the system works is nearly impossible.

This concept is easy to understand with logical systems like software. Even bugs can quickly be understood and fixed. We write tests and tools to give us more insight and help us understand and avoid the same mistakes in the future.

Often times our careers need troubleshooting too. We continue on without feedback from people that can help us get better and be successful. While human systems cannot be understood or tested like software it doesn't mean you should avoid creating mechanisms to better understand how and why things don't go as expected.

**Getting better**

Until the war in Ukraine ends I'm going to be reserving one of my newsletter comments to encourage people to keep yourself informed of the situation and donate to the Ukrainian people, army, and support programs if you're able.

It's important to understand what your own limits are while reading about such tragedies. We cannot ignore them, but make sure they don't consume you.

I've heard so many good things about this program that if you're looking to become a frontend developer this is a great place to start.

If you want to learn more about infosec this site has free and paid self-paced training. It's focused on red teaming but from the looks of it has plenty of introduction and advanced lessons.

This is a good Linux primer for systems administration and Devops engineers. It's not deep in every area, but it gives a good general overview to point you in the right direction for different types of tasks and tools you'll be using.
