**Statistics**

Facts don't convince people.

You don’t have to change someone’s mind. You just need to give them doubts about what they know.

From _How to Lie with Statistics_

You need to learn how to tell stories, not data.

**So much to learn**

In writing the detector for docker socket plugin I had a co-worker review it with me. They are a much better developer than I am. I can make things work, but it's often not idiomatic and many times not clean.

In a 30 minute call with them I learned a lot. I also learned a small bit more about what I don't know (and need to learn more about).

I love when that happens. When someone opens the door to more knowledge that is hard to gain without experience.

Learn from the experiences of others to understand the things data cannot teach you.

Here's a project I spent some time on at work. It makes it easy for you to know if any workloads in a Kubernetes cluster are mounting the docker socket. It's now open source and available as a `krew` plugin.

Running this on your cluster or manifest files should give you confidence to change your container runtime and upgrade to Kubernetes 1.24 once it is released.

I didn't know it was possible to to save your decryption keys in plain text. Extremely useful—and no surprise—that wireshark supports it.

I like it when people take the time to explain the output from commands and how you should read the data. It's a way to learn from other people's experience.

I also didn't know the difference between `traceroute` and `mtr` so this was particularly insightful to know I should be using mtr instead.
