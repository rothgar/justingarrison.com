## Comments

**Shipping products**

Shipping products has been very different throughout my career. In my first developer role the products I created were loosely tied to the product the company made (movies). My second role I created services to help developers create the product (streaming service). My work with EKS Anywhere is a mix of open source and hardware.

All three products have very different lifespans and maintenance cycles. The planning process and timelines were unrecognizable even though my primary responsibility was similar.

The thing that has been the same with all of the products is the day things launch is always a massive collaboration driven by a phone call and spreadsheet. Getting people to do things in order with high probability of public failure is best to be controller synchronously with well documented run books.

**The danger of lies**

If you're new to the newsletter I usually have two comments related to development, but for the past 100+ days I've been dedicating one of these comments to raising awareness to the war in Ukraine.

Last week, Russia bombed a mall killing civilians. The Russians fighting the war are being lied to. They think they're doing the right thing. They think they're eradicating Nazis and lots of other dangerous ideas that would convince them killing innocent people is what they should be doing.

Getting to this point is a steady progression. The rules and regulations that allow a government—and a subset of people in the government—to control information happens over time. The majority of people don't pay attention until it's too late.

Not everyone believes it, but enough people do to keep control. Lies believed by the majority become truth.

I worked for months planning and weeks building this cluster. I'm very excited to finally share it with everyone. I have other content planned but I wanted to share this blog post first so you can see what all went into the build.

This was a good overview of the different types of platforms that get built for running software. Each one further breaks down into smaller categories but this is generally where a lot of them fall.

How to make sense of the overwhelming world of Developer ToolingThi

I bought new Eero 6+ wifi system for home after being un-happy with Ubiquiti for a while. My wifi speeds on my phone increased 5x. I couldn't believe it. This looks like a fun project to get stats from the hardware.
