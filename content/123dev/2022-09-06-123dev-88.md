## Comments

**Culture**

"The emotional intelligence of management is what makes a company culture miserable or excellent." Out of Office: The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working from Home

I read this book last week and it had some really good insights that put words to experiences of corporate America. The main lesson from the book is working remotely is going to amplify the dysfunctions of companies and until bad practices are fixed working remotely isn't going to be the idealistic environment so many people hope it will be.

**We interrupt this regularly scheduled Ukraine conflict update**

Comments are usually reserved for things I learned or tips for development. Ever since the war in Ukraine started I have reserved one of the comments to raise awareness of the conflict.

This week I would like to interrupt the interruption to remind you that transgender rights are human rights and technologies and companies are not politically neutral.

You might have the privilege to ignore politics, but I guarantee you not all of your co-workers or users can. The sooner you listen to how they are impacted by seemingly neutral decisions the better you can understand your privilege and how you can lend it to others.
