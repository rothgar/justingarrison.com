## Picking yourself up

Learning new things is hard. I don't care if it's a programming language, being a parent, or starting a business. One of the hardest things about being a developer is it's such a new profession you're constantly learning new things. If you're not falling on your face once in a while you're not moving forward.

Speaking of something you can pipe commands to, seashells lets you pipe any command output to a URL. I'm still not sure _why_ I like this so much or when I'd ever use it, but it certainly is cool.
