**The longest day of my life**

I flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles last week. The flight left at 0030 on Wednesday the 21st. It was a 6 hour flight to Seoul airport with a 7 hour layover.

The second leg of the flight was 12 hours long and crossed the date line. After 25 hours of traveling I landed at my destination at 1000 the morning of the 21st. Ready to relive the day.

Multiple apps on my phone erased the day I just lived because there was no way to programatically prepare for what just happened. I don't know an answer to this problem, but I hope it's possibleâ€”and easierâ€”in the future.

**Ukraine Update**

I don't know exactly what's going on with the war in Ukraine right now. Based on the few news articles I've read it sounds like I'm not the only one.

I hope this is over soon and people can begin to rebuild their lives.

I have never heard of a hashquine before and it's really cool! A file that displays its own hash. Unfortunately, it's usually accomplished via collision trickery but still a neat concept. Would be awesome to figure out how this could work in a plain text file.

Speaking of decoding things. A good breakdown of how QR codes work.

No, me neither but it's low-key fascinating. (Warning, there is some extremely nerdy shit here.ðŸ‘‡ )

I don't know what I'd use this for but now I want to find something. Either way, it's cool to add custom functions to Google sheets.
