**Experience != expertise**

Lots of companies want you to have experience. They require years of experience with X technology, but those years don't translate to expertise.

Many companies don't require expertise, but because they're not experts themselves they don't know what they need. Years of riding a motorcycle will give you a lot of experience, but the expert level riding in this gif—and a decent amount of luck—show what's possible.

**A non-update update**

I'm writing this newsletter early because I'm traveling. If you're a new subscriber I use a comment each week to raise awareness about the Ukraine war. Assuming it has not ended in the past 11 days—which would be awesome if it peacefully ended—it is still happening and people are still dying.

Even if the war is not in the news that doesn't mean it's not happening or important. There are a lot of terrible things happening in the world right now and I encourage you to protect your own metal well-being to stay healthy and supportive of those around you.
