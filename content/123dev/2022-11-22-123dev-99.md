**Examples**

Documentation comes in many forms. If you want a great article about documentation go back to the very first issue of this newsletter. Once I have learned how something works the best way for me to understand how to use it is with examples.

This week I've been building something without any example code. There is a high level spec, an example (full) implementation, but no simple examples. It has taken me much longer than I expected to reverse engineer my use case without any examples.

The entire world has been impacted by this war, and two people paid the ultimate price last week when rockets hit Poland. This war has been going on for 9 months and should never have happened in the first place. It's not over yet and I'm not sure how it'll end, but I hope it does soon.

Make is one of the tools I love to hate. I put off learning it for a long time because I didn't understand it and thought there were better tools. There are better tools, but none as universally available as make.
