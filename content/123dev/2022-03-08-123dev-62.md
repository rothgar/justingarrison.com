**Priorities**

This newsletter is not important. There is a global pandemic which has killed nearly 6 million people. There is a war in Ukraine which is claiming innocent lives and threatens global peace.

Please prioritize your safety and health. Help where you are able and make sure you set your own boundaries to stay informed but not at the cost of your mental or emotional well-being.

**Packet switching networks**

One of the most interesting technologies I've ever studied is packet switching networking. It's not intuitive that breaking up a message into smaller pieces and letting each of those pieces traverse independently to a destination would increase resilience of the message being received.

The versatility of TCP and UDP allows it to be overlayed, tunneled, and encapsulated with other protocols and functionality. It also allows it to be blocked, filtered, and tracked.

Maybe with the links below you'll find some new ways to use this technology to accomplish your own goals or work around the goals of people and systems trying to limit your own freedoms.

Tailscale is an overlay VPN with some amazing features. If you've never used it before I recommend you check it out. The feature I wanted to share was the new ability to share your exit nodes. Not only can you create a private network but now you can let your friends tunnel their traffic through your nodes.

This can give them the ability to get around restrictive network filters, firewalls, or the ability to hide some of their traffic from onlookers.

This can be helpful for giving contractors private access to a secure server, or sharing a private Minecraft server with friends.

Tunneling your outbound traffic can be useful, but so can tunneling inbound traffic. Often used for sharing a local web server on the internet through tools like ngrok there are lots of alternatives tools available and plenty of other reasons you might need to expose a local port to the world.

If you've ever needed to remotely connect to anything you've probably tried using SSH. It's one of the most versatile connection protocols available. This article shows some SSH use cases you may or may not have used.
