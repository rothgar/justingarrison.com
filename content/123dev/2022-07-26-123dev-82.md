## Comments

**Stories**

I gave an internal talk at work last week about storytelling. I had been stressing about that talk more than any talk I had given recently. The hard part wasn't the lessons or tips about telling stories. The hard part was telling how I learned anyone can be a good storyteller. Taking my own advice and being vulnerable will never be easy.

**Small steps**

If you're new to this newsletter I usually have two comments about development and lessons, but since the war in Ukraine started I have dedicated one of my comments to the war.

This week there was a small step for people and countries that depend on exports that usually come from Ukraine. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to continue to let Ukrainian exportsâ€•mostly foodâ€•to continue to other countries that desperately need it.

I still hope and pray for more steps in the right direction to end this war and let the country begin to heal.

Years ago (around 2006) Linux had a window decorator called Compiz/Beryl. It had a ton of cool visualizations like burning windows and virtual desktops based on a 3D cube. I've been having a lot of fun with this new GNOME extension.

Sometimes we think the only software that's written is frontend and backend. Visual effects has a lot of software too. Not only for the artist tooling, but the scenes themselves are usually very complex and require code to create.

This thread isn't specifically about the software, but still fun to see people celebrate their work and give some information about what it took to create.

I didn't know about this default signal handling in Go. Looks very useful and I know other languages have similar features. Can be very useful for debugging.
