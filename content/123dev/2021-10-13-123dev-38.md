I had a lightning talk for Devops Days Portland called ‚ÄúTikTalk‚Äù about innovation. Please go watch it because it was a lot of fun to make.

Innovation comes in different forms; there are sustaining innovations and disruptive innovations. Most companies need people who can help sustain their innovations. They need to be better, faster, and stronger than they were.

Disruptive innovations are the things that build new businesses‚Äîtypically by destroying old ones. It can come from new technologies or new abilities. The difference between sustaining and disruptive innovations is in the customers.

Sustaining innovations will grow markets because they‚Äôll meet the needs of ever demanding customers. It‚Äôll grow because it‚Äôs finally good enough.

Disruptive innovations will create new customers because it will let non-consumers do something they couldn‚Äôt before. Maybe the old thing required special skills or they couldn‚Äôt do something in a certain setting. It‚Äôll grow because the consumers are good enough.

If you want to learn more I suggest you read¬†*The Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma: The Revolutionary Book That Will Change the Way You Do Business*¬†and¬†*Seeing What‚Äôs Next: Using the Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change*.

Something I wish I understood earlier in my career was how influence at companies worked. I always thought the organization chart was the only way to have influence until I read this and realized the org chart has very little to do with actual influence.

I agree with Shawn that there‚Äôs a lot of value in ‚Äúdistros‚Äù to help make decisions for developers and accelerate what users can build. I‚Äôm a big fan of services like Vercel‚Äîwhere this newsletter is currently hosted‚Äîand they can solve problems for a lot of apps and sites.

However, large apps are complex and specialization doesn‚Äôt always work. If specialized ‚Äúdistro‚Äù providers are going to grow they will either add features and become more complex, or somehow help customers avoid complexity and shift it onto the provider. I don‚Äôt have a lot of hope that complexity will be avoided.

This article has some very good general purpose logging advice for applications written in any language. I like the advice that logs should be

- Descriptive
- Contextual
- Reactive

There‚Äôs also some good specifics in the article on how to set up logging in python. What formatters you should use and how to configure the logger.
