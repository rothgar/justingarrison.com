**Learning new things**

The gif reminded me of what it feels like to be new to something. You think you know where you're going, you start to understand what you're doing, and then you're free falling. You pull the rip cord, gain a resemblance of control, and slow down—just a little bit.

Learning new things doesn't end the way it started and you still don't understand it all, but you're having fun and want more!

**Tech**

I was so optimistic a week ago and this week my optimism was briefly swept away and I was not able to focus. I felt like I was free falling with my eyes closed knowing just how close danger really is.

Tech didn't matter but was a welcome escape to fantasized safety for 20 minutes at a time. It's OK if you felt the same.

My previous role was part of a “developer productivity” team and I like the micro-feedback loops laid out here. I audibly gasped when I read how inefficient environments “focus on trying to spot the under performing developers” because it was too real.

Speaking of making developers productive, being able to find services and who owns them is a huge drain on time especially as teams and companies grow. I’ve seen various products for internal developer portals but rarely are they open source or pluggable. The biggest problem I always see is buy-in from the entire organization usually needs to come from the top.
