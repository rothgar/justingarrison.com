## Comments

**Boundaries**

I've known people who work 60+ hours a week for as long as I've been in tech. It doesn't matter what company you work for, people will always fail at setting boundaries.

Individual contributors failing to set their own boundaries is a problem, but a much bigger problem is when leadership does it. Once leadership does it it becomes an expectation and culturally accepted. If you're in leadership and are not able to finish your work in 40 hours then you need to clearly communicate that with your leadership and make sure you do not set that expectation for people you manage. Once boundaries are not respected in culture it takes multiple generations of employees to reverse the negative effects.

**Destruction**

I continue to use one of my comments to raise awareness about the conflict in Ukraine. Once Russia stops their invasion, I will get back to two comments about development, technology, and lessons.

This week, Russia continued bombing the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Putin also threatened to bomb new locations deeper in Ukraine if they were given long range weapons. To date, all of the aid has been short and medium range weapons.

There is already so much pain in this world and because of one man an entire country is under attack. The destruction and loss they've already faced is something I will never be able to understand.

Git is probably the least intuitive tool that every developer uses. You remember some commands to do your work, but there's always the one person who really understands it. In a lot of ways, it's similar to regex. This game looks like a fun way to understand how git works. You can see a little bit of it in today's gif.

Infrastructure as software has been something I've been talking about and promoting for 5+ years. I finally wrote a blog post so more people can understand how it's different from Infrastructure as Code.
