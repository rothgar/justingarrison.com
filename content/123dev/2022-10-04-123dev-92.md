**Run software only as long as it needs**

The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission happened recently and successfully crashed. I wish more software had a finite life span.

"This is temporary" is a guaranteed way to make sure something runs forever. In my first sysadmin role there were plenty of "quick fixes" I implemented that were still running when I left. They weren't documented and very few people knew why or how they were put in place. I'm pretty sure they've all been replaced, but sometimes I worry my naivete about how long it would have to be run combined with my documentation aversion because it "slowed things down" caused someone to be woken up from an alert and have to fix my fix.

Don't believe any software is temporary unless you know the computer where it runs will experience kinetic energy like the GIF above or first link below.

**So hopeful**

The war in Ukraine is not over but with some recent victories I'm hopeful it can be. The people and country need time to rebuild—physically, emotionally, mentally, economically.

I cannot imagine the loss and pain they have gone through, but the resiliency and spirit of the Ukrainian people has shown me what it's like to be a country united.

Here's a different kind of Dart. I've been learning some mobile development and trying to use Flutter + Dart. This was one of the more complete walk-throughs I found to get started.
