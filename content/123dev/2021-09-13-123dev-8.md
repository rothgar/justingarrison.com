## One more feature

Itâ€™s difficult with software to know when to stop and release what you have. Thereâ€™s always one more feature to create and one more bug to squash. Putting out software you know has bugs or doesnâ€™t do everything you want is anxiety inducing but also freeing because it can only get better from here.

## Side projects

I like side projects because they give me creative outlets and new ways to learn. This newsletter is one of my side projects.

I try to treat my job as a side project to my life. Itâ€™s not as important as my family even if itâ€™s my primary source of income. I didnâ€™t always have this luxury, but I hope you can find a balance for your work and what is important to you.

The gif is from this article about elliptic curve cryptography. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve read this article before but apparently had forgotten a lot about how it works. Itâ€™s worth a (re)read if youâ€™re interested in how newer cryptographic algorithms work.

Daft Punk announced this week that they were breaking up. ðŸ˜¢ Iâ€™ve enjoyed their music and creativity for a long time. This thread with lots of pictures about how the original Daft Punk helmets were created was way more electronics than I expected. I take for granted the plethora of small electronics we have today that didnâ€™t exist 20+ years ago.

The Kubernetes vertical pod autoscaler is really useful for setting your pod resource and requests based on actual usage. The docs are good, but they donâ€™t go into all of the details and considerations as this post. Pointing out that you shouldnâ€™t use the vertical pod autoscaler on the same workloads with horizontal pod autoscaler is something I think a lot of people (including myself) miss.
