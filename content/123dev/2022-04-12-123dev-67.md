**YOLO/CD**

Continuous delivery is built on trust. Trust is gained over time. How do you take the first steps?

You can get some assurances with tests, but they're never enough. You have to start slowly.

1.  Manual deployments to learn the steps and failure modes
2.  Manual automation: automation that's triggered from an engineer
3.  Observed automation: runs on its own but is closely watched by a human for errors
4.  Trust

Soon you'll not care that there's molten iron flowing from your Jenkins servers

**War crimes**

The events in Ukraine are still heart breaking. I will continue to use one of my comments to talk about it instead of my usual tips.

It's sad to me that much of it isn't newsworthy anymore. Humans are so adaptable that weeks of reporting about people dying becomes mundane to hear. It's not until there's new extreme or horrifying information that it gets put into headlines.

Going "back to normal" isn't a thing. We just get used to the current situation until something disrupts it.

I've managed a lot of crons in my time and I wonder if that's a thing of the past. I'm sure on-prem environments still have them but it seems that more and more are moving into container orchestration or higher level tools. In any case this was a good list of recommendations.
