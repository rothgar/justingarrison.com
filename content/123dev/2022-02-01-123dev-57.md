**Movement**

If you look at images you can see art. If you look at art in sequence you can perceive movement. If you perceive movement you can see progress.

Sometimes we get caught up looking at art we forgot to see how it fits into the bigger picture and how much progress we've made.

**Interpreted languages**

Imagine if every computer interpreted code differently depending on what model, operating system, and location where the computer was running. It would be impossible to write a program that would run with any sort of consistency or guarantees.

That's exactly how language between humans works, and somehow it compiles to something meaningful.

I spent a majority of last week trying to compile words into something meaningful. We had to reach consensus about what words mean and how they will be interpreted by others from different backgrounds and at different times in the future.

Telling computers what to do with structured, consistent words and punctuation seems infinitely easier.

Have you ever wondered what it costs to run a website and app such as Lichess? $35,000 per month. A relatively small team runs the site and has a breakdown of all of their costs in a handy google spreadsheet.

Here's a breakdown of a few different projects run by an individual developer. The two coolest parts of this dashboard is the effective hourly rate calculation and the historical view of growth over time. Some people believe creating services have a fast turn around to profit, but this shows development all the way back to 2017 with minimal profits.

Terraform has an infrastructure cost estimation as a paid feature of Terraform Cloud. It's a useful to have an idea of how your changes will effect cost even if you're not on a strict budget.

Infracost is an alternative to the built in feature that puts cost estimates directly in pull requests.
