## Conference
Devops Stage

## Abstract
It’s my first day at Air C and D.
I’m the new SRE and I need to make our service more reliable.
The site goes live in 3 days.
Let’s figure out how to keep our 9s while under pressure of launch.
What components are the most critical to reliability and how can we implement them quickly.
