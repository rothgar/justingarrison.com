## Abstract

Linux is the most popular operating system in the world, but that also makes it the most flexible and complicated to conform to your needs. What if there were a Linux distro without all the stuff you didn't need? Talos is a single purpose Linux built for Kubernetes. It is managed by a gRPC API and only includes the tools required to run containers. Justin will show how it works and how you can use it in everything from a home lab to large cloud environment.
