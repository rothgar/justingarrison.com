## Description

Companies are in a constant state of change as the industry and technologies change around them. How can you make decisions that will change the company in the desired direction? Change is inevitable, but not all changes are desired. From DevOps to RTO, which behaviors are you trying to reinforce and which are you trying to get rid of? We'll look at the study of "Blue Zones" and how they impact people around the world and how organizational and technology decisions have impacted companies for good and bad.
