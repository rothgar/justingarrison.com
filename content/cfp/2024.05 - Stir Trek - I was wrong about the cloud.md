## Abstract

The cloud has enabled countless innovations and powers some of the worlds largest websites. I am the author of Cloud Native Infrastructure and a user for a decade. Now I've changed my mind about when and how cloud environments should be used. Not everything should be on-prem, but we need to decide just how much "heavy lifting" our clouds are doing.
