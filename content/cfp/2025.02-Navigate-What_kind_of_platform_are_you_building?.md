## Description

The hype cycle for Platform Engineering is high, but few companies understand what they're building or why they're building it. Let's look at the different types of platforms, where they fit in the stack, and which ones you should avoid building.
Once we know what we want and why we can begin to have a conversation about what technologies are required. After all of this you'll have a better idea if you need to build vs buy, who your customer is, and why the term Platform Engineering exists in the first place.
