## Program committee description
On-prem Kubernetes environments have often been relegated to DIY approaches with little to no options unless you use a specific hardware or VM vendor. Agnostic approaches exist but are usually tied to cloud vendors. This talk will overview the landscape of offerings and where community vs commercial overlap exists.

## Session outline
* Why on-prem Kubernetes is hard
  * No common infrastructure between environments
  * No APIs for provisioning
* How have people done it in the past?
* Community options
  * Kubeadm
  * Kubespray
* Vendor options
  * Tanzu
  * Anthos
  * EKS Anywhere
  * Omni
