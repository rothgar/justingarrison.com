## Conference
All Day Devops

## Abstract
It doesn't matter if you do it the hard way or with opinionated tooling, Kubernetes cluster creation is a solved problem.
But how many clusters do you need?
The correct amount is N+1.
How can you manage that many clusters, upgrades, security patching, and guarantee workload availability?
We'll look at common patterns for cluster deployments, upgrades, and what components should be decoupled by explaining how the patterns work and how they can be applied to any environment.
