## Elevator Pitch

Bash scripts and cloud-init aren't good enough to build infrastructure in 2024. It's time to build with declarative APIs all they way down to the Linux kernel.

## Abstract

It doesn't matter if you run systems in the cloud or on-prem. Linux is going to be a key part of your stack, but how much Linux do you need to know? Do you remember the commands for systemd and tcpdump? SSH and bash don't scale to today's needs or security requirements. With Talos Linux you can stop spending your time scripting an OS and instead use modern, API driven methods to build more secure and more reliable infrastructure.
