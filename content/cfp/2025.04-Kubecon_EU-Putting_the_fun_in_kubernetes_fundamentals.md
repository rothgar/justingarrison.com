## Description

Many of us are visual learners, but few of us are visual teachers. This talk will build on years of experience teaching Kubernetes concepts in an engaging and memorable way. We will cover concepts such as pods, scheduling, scaling, and load balancing, and you will leave understanding how the different components operates together to make a complete orchestration system.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

This will be an engaging and different way to explain core concepts that people know but don't understand. It will encourage audience participation and give them a starting point to dig deeper. My goal is to make it the most entertaining talk of the entire conference.

## Additional Notes

My videos using props to explain technologies have millions of views on a variety of platforms. I would like to take this style of education and put the pieces together in a bigger way.
Ideally this would be a 10-20 minute keynote that would be able to have props prepared on stage.
