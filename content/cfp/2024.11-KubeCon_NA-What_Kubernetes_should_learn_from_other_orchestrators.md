## Description

Kubernetes does a lot of things well, but it's not the only orchestrator. There are lots of opportunities to learn from other systems that have similar goals and made different decisions. Mesos got some things right and so did Google's Borg. Hashicorp's Nomad is simple and so is Amazon ECS. What lessons can we take away from these systems to make Kubernetes better?

## Benefits to the ecosystem

Kubecon exposes a lot of people to the inner workings of Kubernetes but rarely considers how it compares to other options and why it may be useful to understand other systems.

This talk will expose people to alternatives with an understanding of why they were created and how Kubernetes can adapt some of their features.
