## Conference
All Day Devops

## Abstract
It's day one at Air C and D.
I'm the new SRE and I need to make our service more reliable.
More 9s is all I was told.
Yes, I already asked if moving the decimal was an option.
It is not.
The site goes live in 3 days.
Let's figure out how to keep our 9s while under pressure of launch, performing upgrades, and multi-region deployments.
