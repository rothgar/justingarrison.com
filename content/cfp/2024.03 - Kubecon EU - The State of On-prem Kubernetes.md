## Description
Hardware is hard. Justin was the co-chair of SIG on-prem in 2017 and has been working with home lab and enterprise Kubernetes for 7 years. What are the options for deploying and managing Kubernetes on-prem? Everything from Raspberry Pis, edge environments, and Enterprise hardware.

## Benefits to the ecosystem
This will give an overview of what projects and products are available for clusters running outside of a cloud provider. It will be an overview of various tools with some information about when and where they should be used.

## Additional Resources
I worked on EKS Anywhere (Amazon's on-prem Kubernetes product) but this talk will be about all competing projects and what technologies they use.
