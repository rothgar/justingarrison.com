## Description
You don't run APIs from cgi-bin anymore so why are you still building systems like it's 2010? Security and scalability cannot be bolted on to traditional Linux and we need to have modern tools. We will look at the landscape for Linux without systemd and how to build and maintain systems with API contracts instead of scripts.
