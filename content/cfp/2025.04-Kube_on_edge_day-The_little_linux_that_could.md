## Description

What is the smallest distribution you could build that's full featured for Kubernetes?
Talos Linux is 80MB small with only 12 binaries in the system path.
By building a dedicated Kubernetes distro from scratch the system scales up and down, and has a variety of other useful side effects.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

This talk will help attendees think outside of the box for what a Linux distribution can be.
It will focus on edge use cases such as security, connectivity, and maintenance.
It will also talk about lessons we learned building the system from scratch and how we've had to adapt our assumptions over time.
