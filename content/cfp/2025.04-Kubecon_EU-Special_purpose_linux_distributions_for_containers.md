## Description

This panel brings together representatives from various Special purpose Linux distributions that are part of the CNCF working group. We will discuss what makes these operating systems similar and what sets them apart. Using this information you'll be able to understand what benefits they offer over traditional distributions and when you may want to use each one.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

This panel will help attendees understand why the operating systems were created and what problems they help solve. The panel will have some predetermined questions and will open the discussion to audience questions. It is intended to accelerate research into the options, not declare a specific "best" option.
