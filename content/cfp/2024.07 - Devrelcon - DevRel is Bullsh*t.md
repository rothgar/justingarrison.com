## Abstract

From the popular 2013 essay and the 2018 book it doesn’t matter if you’re part of product, engineering, or marketing, it’s very likely that your job in DevRel is bullsh\*t. By definition these jobs fall into a category of flunkies, goons, duct tapers, box tickers, and taskmasters. Justin will explore how DevRel fits into these categories and how we can find meaning in our careers.
