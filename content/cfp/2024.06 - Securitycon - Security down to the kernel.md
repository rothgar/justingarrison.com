## Description

Everyone knows security is best done in layers. Usually that means adding more layers. This requires more to manage, more resources to pay for, and more overhead. But what if you could gain security by taking away some of the layers? We'll show examples of how we took away layers in Talos Linux to strip and harden the OS with a total of only 12 binaries and a strict focus on Kubernetes.
