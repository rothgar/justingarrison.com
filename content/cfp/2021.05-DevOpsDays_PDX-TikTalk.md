## Conference
DevOpsDays PDX

## Abstract
Technology has cycles of innovation and refinement.
Movements that bring new ideas and ecosystems that refine the ideas into usable tools for a broader audience.
Devops and container orchestration were big ideas that were refined by config management and Kubernetes.
Here we'll explore the patterns and what might be next.
