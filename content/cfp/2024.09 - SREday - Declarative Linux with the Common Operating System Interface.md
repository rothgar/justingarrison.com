## Elevator Pitch

We run declarative systems built on top of an imperative operating system. It’s time we simplified our interface for Linux with a declarative API.

## Abstract

Linux is the foundation for most of the internet, but we’re still building it with Packer and bash scripts. It’s time we had a better, more reliable interface to the Linux Kernel. The Common Operating System Interface (COSI) is setting out to do just that. An API layer on top of Linux that allows for declarative interface for configuring and managing Linux servers. Justin will show how it can be used in Kubernetes, and apply to multiple environments.
