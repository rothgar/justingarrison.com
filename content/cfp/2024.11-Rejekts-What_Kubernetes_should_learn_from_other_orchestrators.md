## Abstract

Kubernetes does a lot of things well, but it's not the only orchestrator. Did you know Meta's Twine orchestrator has millions of machines in a single cluster, Google's Borg doesn't run OCI containers, Amazon ECS has no API versions, and Hashicorp's Nomad is a single binary with built in scheduler and cluster federation? There are opportunities to look at past and present systems to learn about features and architecture decisions that can benefit Kubernetes too.

## Description

Some of these systems are closed sourced and we can only interrogate them from the public information. Looking at blog posts and white papers we can study how these systems were implemented and the different characteristics they have compared to Kubernetes.
