## Abstract

Linux is the most popular operating system in the world but is still configured with shell scripts and obscure commands. Talos is a Linux distribution that is single purpose built for Kubernetes and is completely configured and managed via an API. There's no shell and no SSH.
We'll show how it works and the benefits of a completely API driven OS.
