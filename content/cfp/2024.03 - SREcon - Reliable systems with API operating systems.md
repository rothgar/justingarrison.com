## Program committee description
* What makes up a Linux distro? - setting the stage for what the majority of people are currently using and how we got here
  * Where do we run Linux? - on-prem, cloud, part of larger systems/clusters
  * How do we create those systems? - packer/immutable images. On-demand installs (hardware)
  * How do we manage systems? - config management, cloud-init, etc. Runtime and long running management systems
* Why is this less reliable? - drift, general purpose Linux, too many things to manage/change
* What an API for system management can look like
* How the API can be integrated into other systems - demo and practical use cases with kubernetes
* When API driven operating systems make sense (and when they don't)

## Session outline
