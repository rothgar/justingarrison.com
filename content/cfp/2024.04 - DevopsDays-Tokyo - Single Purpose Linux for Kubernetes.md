## Abstract
Linux is the most popular operating system in the world, but it is too complex to manage. We can automate it and try to maintain the complexity, but what we really need is a simpler interface. Talos is a Linux distribution designed just for Kubernetes. It doesn't do anything else and in this talk we will show all of the things you don't need to worry about with a single purpose Linux distribution.

## Session outline
* What is Linux?
* How we fit Linux to what we need
* Problems with general purpose Linux
* API managed Linux with Talos
* How to manage Linux from KubernetesÂ
