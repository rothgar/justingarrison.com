## Abstract
Docker images aren't just for applications anymore.
They are used as a universal packaging mechanism and a lot has changed with how they are built, distributed, and consumed.
We'll cover some of the biggest advances in container image management and use cases to get you started using images for more than just applications.


Images are core to the containerized developer experience and they have come a long way since their humble beginnings.
In today's container ecosystem we can build containers without a Dockerfile, we can create images that target multiple different application types, and we can distribute the layers faster and more efficiently than ever.


If you think the only way to build and consume a container image is with the traditional docker push and pull workflow you're going to be surprised at how much more can be done.
Dynamically building images, packaging Helm charts, and reducing image pull time are just some of the recent advances in the format and ecosystem.


Justin will dive deep into how the image format can and should be used for a multitude of problems, and what the future of the format entails.
