## Description

Is cloud-init really the best we can do for managing servers? We've gone through a long history of SSH, webmin, and config management. Linux is still a core component to infrastructure maintenance and security and it seems most people have settled on bash scripts are good enough. Let's explore what we've tried and where we're headed as an industry.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

This will give an overview of different management options for Linux and the benefits and drawbacks they've had. It will explore alternative approaches to management such as golden images, single purpose Linux distributions, and API options. Attendees will learn about why technologies were introduced and what problems they solved.
