_Amazon, AWS, Twitch.tv, Whole Foods, Woot, and Audible are among the companies that use document driven meetings to plan and review new products, features, and processes. This is an example PR/FAQ to help you understand the document format. The format is not as important as the process for how it is used. For an example document driven meeting see this video._

**Los Angeles, CA — (justingarrison.com) — May 29, 2023 —** Justin Inc, announced a brand new meeting format for all of your scheduled employee meetings. It does not matter if the meetings are in-person or virtual, this format is based on the meeting format pioneered at Amazon Inc. and available to any company.

_[Problem statement]_ Companies have lots of meetings. They are important to share information, brainstorm new ideas, make decisions, and other activities. Many employees are estimated to be in meetings for more than two-thirds of their working hours, but those employees have little or no tangible output from their meetings and often don't find them useful.

Meetings waste hundreds of millions of dollars for companies and are usually unorganized with no preperation or action items. The style of meetings vary based on the culture of a company and there is little consistency on format depending on who is organizing the meeting. They can be incredibly disruptive for deep work and require synchronous communication with overlapping timezones. Even with questionable value, meetings proliferate on calendars everywhere.

_[Solution]_ Meetings are so problematic that some companies have banned them altogether. But studies have found that meetings are not the problem. Bad meetings are. Recurring meetings that exist because they've always existed, meetings with the same people dominating the conversation, and meetings no one—not even the orginizer—prepared for.

Document driven meetings come from Amazon when Jeff Bezos banned PowerPoint from meetings in 2004. This did not eliminate meetings but new ways of sharing information, coming up with new product ideas, and agreeing on a direction for products and divisions needed to be created. By focusing on text based information sharing it removed a presenter's ability to make captivating slide decks and their charisma and abilities to tell a story. This not only allowed more voices to be heard, it focused the meeting on the information and data rather than the organizer and speaker.

_[Quote]_ “Many, many years ago, we outlawed PowerPoint presentations at Amazon, and it’s probably the smartest thing we ever did.” - Jeff Bezos

_[Call to action]_ Document driven meetings are free and available to everyone. You do not need permission to start implementing them and should try the format at your company. Please copy this document as a template for PR/FAQ and new product idea meetings. There are a variety of other formats for weekly business reviews, user narratives, and any other recurring, data-driven meeting in your company.

## External FAQ

1. What are we launching today?
Today we are launching a new way to run meetings. Meetings are document driven with no preperation required on behalf of attendees. All information to participate in the meeting discussion will be included in the document and read by the group at the begining of the meeting. If there is no document to read, there is no meeting to attend.

2. Why should I use Amazon's meeting format?
Companies with effective meetings are more profitable. Not only does it save money by not wasting time, it accelerates innovation by communicating efficiently and having a written record of what products, features, and directions are prioritized. It also removes biases and allows for voices that are less frequently heard to speak up.

3. How do I get started with document driven meetings?
Start by creating a document format for one or more of your recurring meetings. This can be data intensive weekly or monthly reviews, or product brainstorming sessions in PR/FAQ documents like you're reading now. Make sure the attendees know that at the begining of the meeting you will all be reading the document together. For a demonstration of how this works see this video: 

4. Do I need to change all my meetings?
Document driven meetings work best when there is consistency for the format and discussion styles. You don't _have_ to replace all of your meetings within your orginization, but start with one teams recurring meetings with 3 or more attendees.

5. How does document driven meetings compare with traditional meetings?
Traditional meetings are haphazard, time boxed events that have no consistent format and inconsistent next steps. It is often not clear what the next steps are and even the agreed opon decisions are open for interpretation amoung attendees.
Document driven meetings put the document as the source of truth for is discussed, and what was agreed on. Document history is tracked as are comments and questions from attendees. These comments allow for asynchronous questions from all attendees, and you can gather input from people that don't usually speak up in traditional meetings. Documents are also useful for reducing biases and prejudices against or for the meeting orginizer or person who wrote the document.

They help organizations save money and time by effectively communicating and making sure more voices can participate. They create trackable documents that can be referenced over time to drive concensus for the organization and help onboard new employees.
